# ðŸ¦­ Walrus - AI-Powered Onchain Actions, Simplified

This is a Python chatbot project bootstrapped with `create-onchain-agent`.  
It integrates [AgentKit](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit) to provide AI-driven interactions with on-chain capabilities.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Intuitive Chat Interface** - Talk to your wallet like you'd talk to a friend
- **Smart Wallet Integration** - Seamlessly interact with Coinbase's Smart Wallet API
- **Token Management** - Check balances and transfer tokens with simple commands
- **Real-time Updates** - Stream responses as they're generated
- **Base Sepolia Compatible** - Built specifically for the Base ecosystem

## Prerequisites

Before using `create-onchain-agent`, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (3.10 - 3.12) â€“ [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Poetry** (latest version) â€“ [Installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

`poetry install`

Then, configure your environment variables:

```sh
mv .env.local .env
```

Finally, run the chatbot:

`poetry run python chatbot.py`


## Configuring Your Agent

You can [modify your agent configuration](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit/tree/main/typescript/agentkit#usage) in the `chatbot.py` file.

### 1. Select Your LLM  
Modify the `ChatOpenAI` instantiation to use the model of your choice.

### 2. Select Your Wallet Provider  
AgentKit requires a **Wallet Provider** to interact with blockchain networks.

### 3. Select Your Action Providers  
Action Providers define what your agent can do. You can use built-in providers or create your own.

## Demo Usage
The `demo.py` script walks the agent through key Wallet API operations:

1. Retrieve the smart wallet address
2. Check the wallet's EVM balance
3. Generate a new smart wallet account
4. Request testnet ETH from the faucet
5. (Optional) Send ETH to a destination address

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in this directory with the following keys:
```properties
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
CDP_API_KEY_NAME=your_cdp_api_key_name
CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=your_cdp_api_private_key
PRIVATE_KEY=your_ethereum_private_key
NETWORK=base-sepolia
DEMO_DEST_ADDRESS=optional_destination_address
```

### Running the Demo
Install dependencies and run:
```pwsh
poetry install
poetry run python demo.py
```

### Starting the Chat Agent
Use the provided script to launch the interactive chatbot:
```pwsh
poetry run start-agent
```
